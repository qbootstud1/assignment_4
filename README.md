Your job is to take the Hadamard quantum walk we coded during the session and turn it into a search algorithm by implementing Sticky Walk. The shift operator and most of the walk has already been written for you. It is your job to implement the boolean oracle (through use of an ancilla qubit already added for you) and controlled shift. This can be done in 10 lines of code or less. 

Code for running on a simulator and visualizing the walk has been given for you.

The code frame written belongs to Addie Jordon and Austin Hawkins-Seagram. Please do not share outside of the bootcamp.
